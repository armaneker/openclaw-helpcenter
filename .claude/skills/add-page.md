# Add Page Skill

The user wants to add a new page to Agentic Playbook.

## Instructions

1. **Gather info from the user's message:**
   - Page title (required)
   - Category: one of `openclaw`, `paperclip`, `langsmith`, `skills-and-plugins`, `security`, `case-studies`, `getting-started` (infer from context, or ask)
   - Content description or bullet points (optional — generate helpful content if not provided)

2. **Create the MDX page:**
   - Create directory: `src/app/<category>/<slug>/` where `<slug>` is the kebab-case title
   - Create `page.mdx` inside it
   - Start with `<GuideHeader tool="..." difficulty="..." lastTested="..." readTime="..." />`
   - Use `# Title` as first heading, then content with `##` sections
   - Use `<Callout>` components where appropriate (types: info, warning, tip, danger)

3. **Update navigation:**
   - Add the new page to `src/lib/navigation.ts` under the appropriate section

4. **Optionally update home page:**
   - Add to the `latestGuides` array in `src/app/page.tsx` if it's a significant new guide
   - Update the guide count on the tool card if applicable

5. **Build and verify:**
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure the site builds successfully

6. **Commit and push:**
   - Commit all changes with a descriptive message
   - Push to `main` so GitHub Actions deploys automatically

## Content Style

**Read `.claude/style-guide.md` before writing any content.** It has the full list of banned phrases and writing rules.

Key points:
- Write like a senior engineer talking to a peer. No filler.
- Never use phrases like "hands-on", "production-grade", "dive deep", "let's get started"
- First paragraph: one sentence saying what this page helps you do
- Use bullet lists, not tables, for simple name + description lists
- Include a Troubleshooting section for step-by-step guides
